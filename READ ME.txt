To run my program, first of all you run the server exe and then you run two intances of the client exe
The clients will be asked for their name and this will then be displayed at the top of their window.

To control the clients within the application simply use the arrows keys on your selected window.
When you are finished simply close the windows of the application.
When starting again make sure that the server is restarted as without a restart it will cause the users to crash.
